 * CONTEXT
 *
 * This does very little right now except act as a shared state used
 * by all the tracers in effect to keep track of the current transaction
 * and trace segment. The exit call is VERY IMPORTANT, because it is
 * how the proxying methods in the tracer know whether or not a call
 * is part of a transaction / segment.
 *
 * The relevant code in the Tracer can be adapted to use domains instead
 * of Context very easily, which should make it easy to support both
 * 0.8 and earlier versions from most of the same code.
